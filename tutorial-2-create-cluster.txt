Let's now refine a bit few concepts on the node, and get these concepts in 
action in setting up and deploying a cluster!

The most interesting part of the tutorial is to manage applications on a 
Kubernetes cluster, but it is actually very interesting also to take the time 
to learn how to set a cluster up.

Several scenarios are possible, and we will drill into three options:
    - deploying 3 virtual machines on the laptop, and make one the Master of 
      the cluster, and the two other the Slaves : this is the preferred 
      scenario since the Kubernetes software running on the VMs cannot know 
      that it is all running on the same physical machine, so it gives a very 
      representative setup;
    - deploying the cluster on docker containers, using "Kubernetes-in-Docker" 
      and faking a cluster: this is less representative, but it can run on a 
      much smaller footprint than the previous option (which require a laptop 
      with enough CPU and memeory to accomodate for 3 VM);
    - and finally we need to find a possibility to run this tutorial on a 
      'normal office laptop', i.e. running on windows and with maximum 8GB 
      memory.

The appendix 0 contains the details for the three deployment scenarios. We will 
briefly describe here only the first one, which is actually the one from which 
I have most learnt when writing this tutorial.
